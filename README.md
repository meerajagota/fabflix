# CS122B Project
This project is a movie browsing and shopping system called Fabflix. This website allows users to search for movies by genre, title, year, director, or keyword. Users can sort the search results, browse movie listings, and add selected movies to a shopping cart. The system also includes a credit card verification process for completing purchases.

Note: Include how and where you use the LIKE/ILIKE predicate in your README.md.
