# CS122B Project
This project is a movie browsing and shopping system called Fabflix. This website allows users to search for movies by genre, title, year, director, or keyword. Users can sort the search results, browse movie listings, and add selected movies to a shopping cart. The system also includes a credit card verification process for completing purchases.

Used LIKE/ILIKE in src/MovieServlet.java from lines 90-120 in order to query the database for terms input by the user. Users would submit keywords into text boxes for title/director/etc and ILIKE/LIKE would be used in order to find titles/directors/etc in the moviedb that matched the query.
